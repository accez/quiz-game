# Movie quiz
A quiz game i made for a technical assignment. The quiz generates 10 random questions where you have 15 seconds to answer the correct one.
You also get two lifelines that you can use to help you out during the game. "50/50" which eliminates 2 incorrect answers, and "+10 sec" which gives you another 10 seconds to answer the current question.
